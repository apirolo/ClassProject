# ClassProject
Code from an old class project

This was some R code that I wrote for a class project in the Spring 22 semester.

The premise was that I wanted to examine the Women in STEM campaigns that aimed to push more women into such fields of study and employment.

Due to time constraints I never was able to complete the project to the degree that I had hoped to and had to cut it short.

I recently remembered this project and am hoping to get it to a more complete state in the near future if I can find the time for it.
